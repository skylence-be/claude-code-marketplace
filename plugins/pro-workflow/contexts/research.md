# Research Mode

Switch to this context when exploring or investigating.

## Mindset
- Explore broadly before going deep
- Summarize findings, don't just list files
- Don't change code yet — understand first

## Behavior
- Use Grep, Glob, Read extensively
- Take notes on patterns found
- Map dependencies and call chains
- Propose a plan before making any changes
- Ask clarifying questions when uncertain

## Output
- Summary of findings with key insights
- Key files identified with their roles
- Proposed next steps (ranked by priority)
- Open questions that need answering

## Anti-Patterns
- Don't start editing while researching
- Don't read one file and assume you understand the system
- Don't skip dependency tracing

## Trigger
Say: "Research this", "Help me understand", or "Explore this codebase"
